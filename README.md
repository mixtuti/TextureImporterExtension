# How to Usd TextureImporterExtension

→[日本語はコチラ](https://github.com/mixtuti/TextureImporterExtension/blob/main/README-JP.md)←<br><br>

When importing sprites in Unity, Texture Type is set to "Default".<br>

Personally, I use "Sprite (2D and UI)" more often, <br>
so I thought, **It's troublesome if "Default" is the default!** <br>
This is a not-so-useful editor extension that I created with that in mind.
<hr>

## How to use
① Download the folder called “Editor”<br>
② Put the downloaded file into the “Assets” folder<br>
③ It's over! <br>

```
Assets
├Editor
│　 └TextureImporterExtension.cs
```

If the folder structure is like this, it will be a success.
